Student Management REST API with Spring Boot üöÄ
This project is a RESTful API developed in Java with the Spring Boot framework. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage a "Student" entity, with a special focus on a robust and centralized exception handling system.

‚ú® Features
Complete CRUD Endpoints: Implementation of all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for full student management.

Global Exception Handling: Uses the @ControllerAdvice annotation to centrally catch exceptions and return standardized error responses.

JSON Error Responses: In case of an error (e.g., student not found), the API returns a structured JSON body, making it easy for front-end clients to integrate.

Custom Exceptions: Creation of application-specific exceptions (StudentNotFoundException) for more semantic error control.

üö® Error Handling
When an operation fails, such as trying to fetch a student with a non-existent ID, the API returns a standardized JSON error response with the appropriate HTTP status.

Example response for a student not found (Status 404 Not Found):

JSON

{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Student id not found",
  "timeStamp": 1678886400000
}
This logic is managed globally by the StudentRestExceptionHandler class, which uses @ControllerAdvice.
